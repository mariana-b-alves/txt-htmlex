    <p>The Dream Chapter: Star, our debut album, was about the "happiness and excitement of meeting that special someone." The Dream Chapter: Magic was about our magical adventures that we set on as a group of friends. Our newest, The Dream Chapter: Eternity carries on that story -- our group of friends hits a wall as we confront reality</p>
