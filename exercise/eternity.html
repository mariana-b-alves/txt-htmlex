    <h2>About The Album</h2>

    <p><strong>The Dream Chapter: Eternity</strong> (Korean: 꿈의 장: Eternity; RR: Kkum-ui Jang: Iteoniti) is the second extended play (EP) by South Korean boy band Tomorrow X Together. It was released on May 18, 2020 by Big Hit Entertainment and Republic Records. It serves as a follow-up to the band's first studio album The Dream Chapter: Magic (2019). The album contains six songs, including the lead single, "Can't You See Me?". Musically, the album incorporates several genres including funk-pop, dreampop, trap, hip hop and alternative R&B.</p>

        
    <p>Tomorrow X Together's comeback was much-anticipated after the band won several rookie awards at year-end Korean award shows, including Mnet Asian Music Awards, MelOn Music Awards, and Golden Disc Awards. On April 28, 2020, Big Hit Entertainment announced the upcoming release of Tomorrow X Together's second EP, The Dream Chapter: Eternity, through a motion graphics video teaser. It follows the band's debut extended play The Dream Chapter: Star and their first studio album The Dream Chapter: Magic which together comprise their successful "The Dream Chapter" series featuring stories of growth </p>

    <p>"The Dream Chapter: Star, our debut album, was about the "happiness and excitement of meeting that special someone." The Dream Chapter: Magic was about our magical adventures that we set on as a group of friends. Our newest, The Dream Chapter: Eternity carries on that story -- our group of friends hits a wall as we confront reality - Tomorrow by Together"</p>
